# Simple Shop App

My first fully designed and created project in React. Bootstraped with create-react-app.

##Preview available at https://MartynaObrebska.github.io/shop-app .

First thing to do is to search the products from selected category in the header. If you select the product you can see all products details. 
Than you can set the quantity, preferred currency and add it to the basket.
If you click the basket icon you go to basket card and see all the selected products and total price. From here you can also change the quantity of products, selected currency and remove products from the basket.
